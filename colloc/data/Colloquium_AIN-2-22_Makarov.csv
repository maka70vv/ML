Algorithm,"A set of instructions (frequently Mathematical in nature), written down as a series of steps, which are generally iterated through many times in order to achieve some task or find some result. Computers are good at running algorithms.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#algorithm
Analysis,"Analysis is a word used in many contexts. Formally it means the breaking down of something (normally something complex) into smaller and simpler constituent parts, each of which may be studied more easily, allowing insight (small ‘i’) to the more complex whole to be obtained. The word itself comes from the Greek, ἀνάλυσις (análusis, “a breaking up”, from ana- “up, throughout” and lusis “a loosening”).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#analysis
Analysis Facility,"Analysis Facility is a high-level term used to describe a packaged up combination of tools and Data necessary to carry out specific sets of Analyses. Such a facility might include a selection of the following: analysis tools such as OLAP Cubes, Data Visualisation capabilities and maybe just linked Excel spreadsheets; Query / data extraction tools (like SQL or Pig), programming languages / environments (like R or Python) and the data which they will all access, most likely pre-formatted and consolidated to make working with it easier.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#analysis-facility
Analytical Repository,"A Data Repository which forms a major part of a modern Data Architecture and is focussed on supporting the generation of Insight (cf. an Operational Repository, which is focussed on supporting the generation of Information). An Analytical Repository will hold a wide variety of both internally and externally sourced data, often in raw form, but sometimes also Curated.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#analytical-repository
Analytics,"Deriving Insights from Data which are generally beyond the purpose for which the Data was originally captured  – to be contrasted with Information which relates to the meaning inherent in Data (i.e. the reason that it was captured in the first place). Analytics often employ advanced statistical techniques (logistic regression, multivariate regression, time series analysis etc.) to derive meaning from Data.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#analytics
Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection),"Techniques, used in Data Mining and elsewhere, for identifying points in a set of Data that do not conform to the general characteristics of the rest of the Data. A classic example would be detecting fraudulent transactions amongst the overwhelmingly larger number of legitimate transactions processed by a bank or credit card company. More seriously it could be identifying which of a number of photographs of chronic skin lesions could instead be a malignant tumour. Equally the objective could be to discard anomalous Data that is otherwise skewing a population (e.g. the one multi-billionaire in a sample of 5,000 people).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#anomaly-detection
Anonymisation,"Anonymisation is one approach to ensuring the Protection of Personal Data. The term drives from “anonym”, which means “no name” in Greek.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#anonymisation
Python,A Open Source programming language that is often the tool of choice for Data Scientists manipulating large Data sets. Some reasons for this include its ease of use and its extensive libraries of statistical capabilities.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#python
API,See: Application Programming Interface.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#api
Application Programming Interface (API),"An Application Programming Interface is a way for two pieces of code (whole applications or components) to interact. This will consist of a set of rules that tell the developer of a computer programme how get another piece of code (whose internal logic is not necessarily accessible to the developer, i.e. a “black box”) to do something. The API will tell a user what requests they can make of the code, how to make them and what they can expect in return.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#application-programming-interface
Artificial Intelligence (AI),"A scientific discipline devoted to the in silico creation of cognitive agents which mimic (or exceed) the behaviour of self-aware systems (such as humans). Milestones in AI include beating humans at Chess (IBM Deep Blue 1996), Jeopardy (IBM Watson 2011) and Go (Google AlphaGo 2016). Self-driving cars are another current example of AI in action.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#artificial-intelligence
Artificial Intelligence Platform,A class of software that wraps AI capabilities in a user interface that allows them to be leveraged by people who do not have a PhD in the field. Some such platforms will also support non-AI statistical approaches such as Linear Regression. Others attempt to make what is sometimes a “black box” process more transparent and thus auditable. AI Platforms will also typically have built in Data Visualisation capabilities.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#ai-platform

Bayes’ Theorem (Bayesian Inference / Bayesian Network),"A form of Bayes’ Theorem was proved by the Reverend Thomas Bayes at some point in the late 1750s (he never published his work, which only came to light after his death in 1761). It is a theorem in Probability Theory and relates to the probability of some event, , occurring, given that some other event, , has occurred. This is called conditional probability. A statement of Bayes’ Theorem in Mathematical language is:",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#bayes-theorem
Behavioural Analytics,"A discipline focussed on how users interact with mobile applications and web-sites in order to anticipate and meet their future wants and needs. A very basic example is a web grocer reminding you to purchase items that you generally buy, but which are not in your current shopping basket. Slightly more advanced would be an online store suggesting  items that you might be interested in, based on those you have both looked at and purchased historically (“if you liked X, you might like Y”; “people who bought W, also bought Z” etc.). Behavioural Analytics can also help to better design web-sites so that people reaching them as a result of searching for a product have this prominently displayed to them.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#behavioural-analytics
Big Data,A suite of Open Source technologies (clustered around the Apache Hadoop platform) which leverage multiple commodity servers to spread the load of storing and processing very large Data sets (such as those created by the Internet of Things) and provide a range of tools and software that support advanced statistical analysis. These servers can be on-premises or cloud-based with associated security. Big Data technologies are particularly adept at handling Unstructured Data.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#big-data
Big Table,"Google’s proprietary distributed Database platform, which underpins Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube and many other well-known services. It is the precursor to Big Data technologies and Hadoop in particular.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#big-table
Binary,"Our normal number system, Decimals, is based on powers of 10 (hence 100 = 102, 1,000 = 103) and employs positional notation, i.e. the decimal number 48,037 is equal to: 4 × 104 + 8 × 103 + 0 × 102 + 3 × 101 + 7 × 100 (noting of course that anything to the power 0 is equal to 1).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#binary

Business Analyst (BA),"Business Analysts are people who focus on gathering requirements for the development of IT systems (or networks of such systems), changes to existing ones, or to guide the implementation of commercially available software. The level of technical ability that a BA possesses can vary immensely and some may have no experience of either design or coding, whereas others may be quite technically proficient. However, it is more important that the BA has a strong background in processes as it is business processes that generally need to be better supported (or introduced) as a result of their work. If a BA also has design skills, this can help to smooth the handover of work to internal IT or third party staff.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#business-analyst

Chart (Graph),A Chart is a way to organise and Visualise Data with the general objective of making it easier to understand and – in particular – to discern trends. Below is presented – in alphabetic order – a selection of frequently used Chart types:,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#chart
Note:,"Throughout I use the word “category” to refer to something discrete that is plotted on an axis, for example France, Germany, Italy and The UK, or 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. I use the word “value” to refer to something more continuous plotted on an axis, such as sales or number of items etc. With a few exceptions, the Charts described below plot values against categories. Both Bubble Charts and Scatter Charts plot values against other values.",Analytics,None
Chief Analytics Officer (CAO),"An executive charged with most aspects of exploitation of Data in an organisation. Areas typically owned by a CAO would include: Data Science, Data Visualisation, Predictive Analytics, Business Intelligence and sometimes both a Data Service and Regular Reporting. A CAO would not normally be accountable for the control of Data (e.g. Data Governance), with this side of the Data arena owned by a Chief Data Officer. However, either the CAO or the CDO could be the top Data job, with accountability across the whole Data landscape.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#chief-analytics-officer
Chief Data Officer (CDO),"The person fulfilling the top Data job in an organisation and accountable for how Data is both controlled and leveraged in pursuit of executing the organisation’s strategy. The CDO is a business role, but with significant technical experience. It most typically reports to the Chief Operating Officer, but other potential structures could see this role reporting to any number of other top-level CxO roles, including directly to the CEO.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#chief-data-officer
Clickstream Analysis (Clickstream Analytics),"A Clickstream is essentially the path that someone browsing a web-site takes through its pages and sections. For a given user (either one logged in to their account and thus tagged with a persistent ID, or a casual visitor, who is typically allocated a one-off ID), it includes actions (such as clicking on a link to another part of the site, clicking on a link to another part of the Internet – e.g. an advertiser, or closing the site) and the time at which these occurred, together with technical information, such as how quickly a page was displayed to a user.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#clickstream-analysis

Column Chart,See Chart.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#column-chart
Columnar Database (Column-oriented Database),"In a Relational Database all sales would be gathered into a single Table (or set of related tables). The row is the primary entity in such a Database. Each row of our sales table would have columns such as customer name, product purchased etc. A columnar version of the same Database swaps the emphasis. One structure would have all the customer entries stored together, another all the products. This greatly speeds up the look-up of specific attributes.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#columnar-database
Column-oriented Database,See Columnar Database.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#column-oriented-database
Complex Event Processing,"This is a way to monitor streams of Data from more than one source, often in real-time, in order to identify threats, opportunities or simply just patterns. An example might be connecting Social Media Sentiment Analysis with the content of call-centre conversations. This might lead to the deduction that these is either an uptick in demand for an organisation’s products or services or that there might be some reputational issue that could have an adverse impact. Some automated trading algorithms in Financial Services might use elements of CEP to identify buy or sell opportunities related to real world events.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#cep
Computer Vision,See: Image Recognition.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#computer-vision
Conformed Data (Conformed Dimension),"Conformed can almost be viewed as a synonym for standardised. Conformed Data is data which means precisely the same thing in all parts of a Data Repository. So, if there are separate Files or Tables providing customer details, which have different records, or different values within records, then customer data is not conformed. In a more technical sense, pertaining to Data Warehousing, a Conformed Dimension is one which plays exactly the same role for all Fact Tables.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#conformed-dimension
Conformed Dimension,See: Conformed Data.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#conformed-data
CRM,See: Customer Relationship Management.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#crm
Customer Relationship Management (CRM),"A class of systems designed to support interactions with customers (often in a call-centre and/or sales organisation setting). Because Customer Data is just one class of Data, CRM systems need to be closely integrated with both Systems of Record and Data repositories in order to be accurate and to avoid duplicate entry of Data.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#customer-relationship-management
Cube,See Multidimensional Approach.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#cube
Dashboard,"A Dashboard is a single page or pane (often a web-page) which simultaneously displays multiple different measurements of the performance of an organisation or sub-unit of this (division, department, geographic territory). The Information is generally at a high-level (with the ability to look into more details if required) and at least some of it may be presented in graphical form (e.g. charts, traffic lights, dials and more advanced Data Visualisations).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#dashboard
Data,"Originally the plural form of the Latin word datum. In itself, datum is a past participle of the Latin verb dare (do, dare, dedi, datus) meaning “to give”; hence words like “donor” and “donate” in English and donner, which is the verb “to give” in French (English “give” comes instead from the German geben).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data
Data Analyst,"A person who analyses Data. Once more there is no ISO definition, Data Scientists analyse Data, Data Miners analyse Data, Data Modellers analyse Data, Catastrophe Modellers analyse Data and so do a wide range of other people. Here I will use the term Data Analyst to apply to the non-statistical analysis of Data. So a Data Analyst would be involved in sourcing Data, combining different Data sets, cleansing or otherwise filtering Data and producing analyses and graphical exhibits based on it. However such work would fall short of building models from the Data, applying algorithms or other statistical techniques (most Data Analysts could do a simple linear regression if necessary, so the boundaries are not sharp). Such work would tend to be ad hoc. If an analysis becomes one that is needed periodically, the specification would be handed to other staff to productionalise it.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-analyst
Data Asset,"In accounting, an Asset is a possession of a company that has intrinsic value, for example, unpaid sales invoices, buildings, computer equipment or indeed goodwill. Data Assets are Data owned by a company that also has intrinsic value. This could be because such Data helps to better pilot the organisation, provides Insights that allow the development of new products or markets, allows customers to be better served, or a hundred other things. In some cases, rather than the preceding, which are all essentially intangible assets, Data may have an actual market price, making it all too tangible.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-asset
Data Audit,"This describes a physical, automated, or (most frequently) mixed review of Data held in either a specific System or Database, or a collection of these forming part or all of an overall systems landscape. The output of this will be varied, potentially systematically highlighting specific Database-level errors or omissions (e.g. missing customer consent fields), pointing out more general issues with the validation of Data on entry or interface, mentioning weaknesses in processes or education and also commenting on any Architectural problems. It is likely that, as well as more granular content, a Data Audit will include some high-level indication of Data health, such as a Red/Amber/Green (RAG) assessment, or commentary as to the current state.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-audit
Data Architecture,"(1) The practice of determining business needs, modelling these and mapping them to appropriate Data structures, systems landscapes and integration / interface strategies. Data Architects generally have an in-depth understanding of Data and its usage and so can be more technologically experienced than some architects in other fields.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-architecture
Database,"While it could be argued that this term could be applied to analogue systems such as index cards at a physical library, it is generally taken to refer software that enables the storage and retrieval of numbers and text in digital format, i.e. Data. Databases differ from Flat-files in that they often contain structures (e.g. Tables, Views and indexes) intended to facilitate these tasks and come with tools that enable the efficient management and manipulation of the Data they contain.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#database
Data Business Analyst,"A person who has extensive understanding of both business processes and the Data necessary to support these. A Business Analyst is expert at discerning what people need to do. A Data Analyst is adept at working with Datasets and extracting meaning from them. A Data Business Analyst can work equally happily in both worlds at the same time. When they talk to people about their requirements for Information, they are simultaneously updating mental models of the Data necessary to meet these needs. When they are considering how lightly-documented Datasets hang together, they constantly have in mind the business purpose to which such resources may be bent.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-business-analyst
Data Capability,"For once the term Data Capability is very close to the everyday meaning of the work “capability”, which relates to having the power, aptitude or know-how to accomplish something. So the Data Capabilities of an organisation reflect its abilities to drive positive outcomes relating to data; e.g. the availability of timely, accurate and pertinent Information is predicated, in part, on competencies in areas such as Data Quality, Data Integration and Data Visualisation.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-capability
Data Capability Assessment,See Data Capability Review.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-capability-assessment
Data Capability Framework (Data Capability Model),"A framework, often visual, organising Data Capabilities into a hierarchy. This may often be in the context of work to assess existing Data Capabilities or desired future ones.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-capability-framework
Data Capability Model,See: Data Capability Framework.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-capability-model
Data Capability Review (Data Capability Assessment),"A structured process aimed at assessing the current Data Capabilities of an organisation (generally against a Data Capability Framework), the desired future Data Capabilities, or both. The current state assessment will identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and risks associated with the data landscape (cf. Data Maturity); often accompanied by recommended actions. Such work is often an element of broader activities to create a Data Strategy.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-capability-review
Data Catalogue,"[US: Data Catalog] A Data Catalogue is a mechanism for indexing, tagging and documenting sets of data in a Data Repository (typically a Big Data one, such as a Data Lake) that supports searching and typically will also have facilities for users to rate or comment on data-sets, providing assistance to future users in their searches. The overall concept is not very far away from Amazon’s on-line store.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-catalogue
Data Category,See Data Classification.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-category
Data Classification (Data Category),"This refers to categorising – and sometimes tagging – Data in order to separate out what it is used for, how it is treated, where it is stored and a variety of other purposes. A canonical classification might be to do with elements of Security or Privacy, with Data being split into, say, highly sensitive (e.g. medical records), confidential (e.g. contracts and maybe certain transactions), personally identifiable (e.g. names and contact details) and less restrictive categories, including even publicly available. A further classification might apply different archival and retention timeframes to different types of Data. Classification could also be for technical reasons, like ensuring that frequently used Data has its speed of access optimised.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-classification
Data Cleansing,"At the positive end of things, this can refer to the harmless (and useful) activity of de-duplicating records, fixing inconsistencies in capitalisation, quarantining Data with issues for later review and so on. At the other end of the spectrum we have less helpful (and often harmful) activities that could include picking values to fill empty fields, permanently excluding records, or recalculating figures according to some improved formula. In the author’s opinion, these all present a slippery slope leading to Data massaging and should be either used very sparingly or avoided altogether.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-cleansing
Data Community,"An organisation-wide “coalition of the willing” encompassing a wide range of people who work with data in their day-to-day jobs. This would include members of a formal Data Function, but also people like Management Information analysts, report writers, geospatial analysts, people engaged in Statistical Modelling, Excel jockeys and all types of Data Wranglers drawn from all over the organisation, both geographically and by function. The idea here is that there tends to be a large number of people involved in using data and it makes sense to help each other out. Data Communities can also be vehicles for nudging an organisation towards sensible common standards and methodologies and even common tooling.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-community
Data Consistency,"Rather tautologically, this refers to consistency of Data; which has a connection to Data Integrity. This may be at various levels. At an overall architectural level, an example might be that sales from a Retail system are properly reflected in an Accounting system, or in an underlying Database. Also where, for speed of access, the same Data is mirrored to different Databases (e.g. in different countries), Data Consistency would relate to ensuring that changes to one local copy are reflected in all other copies and maybe a central master. Data Consistency can also be at the level of a single Database, with Referential Integrity being an example from the world of Relational Databases.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-consistency
Data Controller,"Under GDPR, a Data Controller is an organisation who is accountable for the collection, storage, use and deletion of data belonging to individuals, known as Subjects. The Data Controller would have the primary relationship with the Subject and determines the use of the Subject’s data, but they may cede the actual processing of data to a third party, known as a Data Processor.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-controller

Data Curation,Contributor: Tenny Thomas Soman,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-curation
Data Democratisation,"This describes a process of making Data (and Information) more widely available in an organisation and, in particular, to non-specialist staff. Such a process is necessary where previously specific IT skills and security rights were necessary in order to access Data. Of course such access needs to come will appropriate controls from a Security and regulatory perspective.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-democratisation
Data Dictionary,"No, this is not a self-referential definition (this page is actually more accurately described as a Data Glossary in any case). Instead a Data Dictionary is a set of entries describing the elements of a Database (or part of it). For a Relational Database, this would include Tables, Views and perhaps indeces. Considering the example of a Table, the Data Dictionary would include:",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-dictionary
Data Discovery,"A process by which generally numerate, but not necessarily technical, staff are able to explore (generally Curated) Datasets, perform their own analyses and create their own reports.

Data Engineering,"Essentially a support function for Data Science. If you consider the messy process of sourcing Data, loading it into a repository, cleansing, filling in “holes”, combining disparate Data and so on, this is a somewhat different skill set to then analysing the resulting Data. Early in the history of Data Science, the whole process sat with Data Scientists. Increasingly nowadays, the part before actual analysis begins is carried out by Data Engineers. These people often also concern themselves with aspects of Master Data Management and Data Architecture.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-engineering
Data Enrichment,"Data Enrichment describes the process of merging datasets to create a new and more valuable set of data. Typically external data (for example demographic data) may be combined with internal transactional data to (again for example) allocate customers to a specific demographic category. Or external mapping data might be combined with a customer’s post code (zip code) data in order to place their residence on a Data Visualisation. In either case, you end up with a dataset that can be used in ways that the original could not.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-enrichment
Data Ethics,"The practices and policies of an organisation that ensure that Data is used not only in a way that is compliant with regulations, but in an ethical manner; generally one that would stand up to external scrutiny. This involves questions such as: “Is customer Data used in a manner that the customer would approve of?”, “How do we use Data to provide better products or services to our customers without appearing intrusive or manipulative?” and “What decisions relating to business partners do we make using Data and what principles underpin these?”",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-ethics
Data Federation,Data Federation is a type of Data Virtualisation. What Data Federation typically does in addition to vanilla Virtualisation is to apply a consistent Data Model across the different source Databases.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-federation
Data Function,"A Data Function is a team of people dedicated to taking all aspects of the data arena forward at an organisation. Such teams will have responsibilities ranging from Data Science and Machine Learning; to Analytics, Business Intelligence and Data Visualisation; to Data Governance, Data Management and Data Quality improvement. These areas will be underpinned by a focus on Data Strategy (development and execution), Data Architecture and Data Operating Model. In some organisations, the members of a Data Function are co-located; in others the team is spread across multiple offices or indeed countries. There are advantages and drawbacks to both arrangements, but in either case the Data Function needs to operate as a cohesive whole. Equally, in some organisations, the Data Function will have direct responsibility for all aspects of data; whereas in others, such responsibility may be shared with other groups, e.g. analytics teams embedded in business functions, the Risk department or parts of the IT organisation.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-function
Data Governance,"The management processes, policies and standards necessary to ensure that Data captured or generated within an organisation is of an appropriate standard to use, represents actual business facts and has its integrity preserved when transferred to repositories (e.g. Data Lakes and / or Data Warehouses, General Ledgers etc.), especially when this transfer involves aggregation or merging of different Data sets. The activities that Data Governance has oversight of include the operation of and changes to Systems of Record and the activities of Data Management and Analytics departments (which may be merged into one unit, or discrete but with close collaboration).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-governance
Data Governance Committee,A Data Governance Committee is a group of people who are collectively accountable for (amongst other things):,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-governance-committee
Data Governance Framework,"Generically a framework is a structure within which you place things in order that they form a coherent part of an overall whole. Similarly, a Data Governance Framework is the aggregation of organisation structures, processes, controls and sometimes systems that support Data Governance. From an organisational point of view, a network of Data Owners and Data Stewards (together with the forums they interact in) would play a central role in such a framework. Processes such as the peer-review of entered data or the training of new starters in how to use an organisation’s systems would also contribute. A robust approach to Data Issue Management would also be a typical framework element. Activities such as Data Classification or Data Lineage also fall into the framework.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-governance-framework
Data Governance Working Group,"A Data Governance Working Group, as the name applies, is a working group focussed on Data Governance. It typically sits under a Data Governance Committee and typically meets more frequently. Rather than the Data Owners populating the Data Governance Committee, the Data Governance Working Group has Data Stewards as its primary members; but some people will attend both (e.g. both would typically be chaired by someone like a Head of Data Governance).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-governance-working-group
Data Ingestion,"The process of bringing raw, untransformed Data into a Big Data repository, such as a Data Lake.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-ingestion

This can involve processes like Extract Transform and Load, creating Views combining multiple tables in a Relational Database, or generating new physical Data structures duplicating several existing ones in Hadoop.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-integration
Data Integrity,"Related to the concept of Data Quality, but generally thought of as more holistic in nature. For example, server malfunction or fires in Data Centres would be something that a Data Integrity specialist might worry about. In addition, while some people use the two terms interchangeably, but Data Integrity often emphasises not only the correctness and completeness of individual Data items, but that they are related properly to other relevant Data items, encompassing things like Referential Integrity. An area of focus for Data teams is often to preserve Data Integrity through the processes of it being collated with other Data and transformed to either adhere to a consistent Data Model or to better represent actual business events.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-integrity
Data Issue Management (DIM),"This is a part of a Data Governance Framework and refers to processes, systems and meetings surrounding Data Issues. Data Issue Management encompasses the capture of Data Issues in a register, their investigation / analysis, design (and costing) of remedial actions, the prioritisation of these (often by a Data Governance Committee) and oversight of work to address the issue. DIM also includes tracking and reporting on Data Issues.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-issue-management
Data Lake,A Big Data repository in to which copies of source systems are periodically replicated. The Data Lake is the one of the resources that Data Scientists leverage to create Insight.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-lake
Data Lineage,"There may be a long and circuitous trip from when Data is first entered into a System of Record (or interfaced into it) and it appearing on – for example – a Dashboard. Data Lineage is about documenting this journey. Thus it will first describe where Data was initially captured, in which system, table and field. Next it will cover how this Data has moved about, for example, being interfaced to a second system, or picked up and transferred by ETL code. In particular Data Lineage will also catalogue any changes to Data, for example Data Cleansing, or the allocation of values to empty fields etc. Data Lineage can be thought of as a genealogy of Data items appearing in reports and analyses.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-lineage
Data Management,"The day-to-day management of Data within an organisation, which encompasses areas such as Data Architecture, Data Quality, Data Governance (normally on behalf of a Data Governance Committee) and often some elements of Data provision and / or regular reporting. The objective is to appropriately manage the lifecycle of Data throughout the entire organisation, which both ensures the reliability of Data and enables it to become a valuable and strategic asset.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-management
Data Marketplace,"An adapted version of a Data Lake which is distinguished by being Curated, both by experts and – to a more limited degree – regular users; by having a robust Catalogue of Data-sets, which again users can help to maintain; and by having a front-end analogous to an on-line store where users can search for Data, access it and provide feedback / ratings on its usefulness, helping others to zero in on the most valuable and pertinent Data-sets. Think Amazon for Data.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-marketplace
Data Mart,"Part of a Data Warehouse devoted to a specific subject area, e.g. Finance, Sales etc.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-mart

Ordered tiers of Data Maturity can be used to form a Data Maturity Model, which allows organisation to see where currently sits versus where it aspires to be with respect to data.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-maturity
Data Maturity Model,"A diagram cataloguing of a number of strata of high-level Data Maturity levels, presented in order from less mature to more mature and often employing visual metaphors such as ladders or staircases. Where an organisation currently sits with respect to its overall Data Maturity may be plotted on such an exhibit and often contrasted with their aspirations for future enhanced Data Maturity. Such a model is generally based on a Data Capability Framework and forms one output from a Data Capability Review.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-maturity-model
Data Migration,"The process of moving Data from one place to another, often a legacy system to a new one, or from old Data Repositories to a new one. This requires a very good understanding of the structure of Data in both the source and target systems and may involve elements of Data Integration.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-migration
Data Mining,"The process of sifting through generally large Data sets to discern meaning, uncover new facts and relationships and establish useful patterns. There is a connection here to some of the activities carried out by Data Scientists, though some aspects of Data Mining may be automated. Data Mining may leverage Big Data implementations, but has been carried out successfully on other types of Databases for many years before the advent of these.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-mining
Data Model,"A Data Model is a diagram which documents how various elements of Data (e.g. a business entity, such as “customer” or a more physical entity such as a set of “customer” Tables) fit together with other elements (e.g. “customer orders”) and relate to whatever is being modelled, e.g. a business process or type of transaction. Data Models can have different levels of abstraction. Some may deal only with high-level business descriptions, others may delve into how these are represented in actual Databases.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-model
Data Modelling,"The process of examining Data sets (e.g. the Database underpinning a system) in order to understand how they are structured, the relationships between their various parts and the business entities and transactions they represent. While system Data will have a specific Physical Data Model (the tables it contains and their linkages), Data Modelling may instead look to create a higher-level and more abstract set of pseudo-tables, which would be easier to relate to for non-technical staff and would more closely map to business terms and activities; this is known as a Conceptual Data Model. Sitting somewhere between the two may be found Logical Data Models. There are several specific documents produced by such work, one of the most common being an Entity-Relationship diagram, e.g. a sales order has a customer and one or more line items, each of which has a product.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-modelling
Data Operating Model,"An Operating Model is a description of how an organisation works; the things it does, the way that it does them and the people, process and technology involved. There is often a focus on the value delivered. As well as describing the current state, Operating Models are often developed as a guide to a desired future state; in this circumstance the term Target Operating Model (or TOM) is often employed. TOMs are often drawn up as a precursor to transformation programmes or organisational redesign.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-operating-model
Data Owner,"A senior person (often an Executive or other Senior Manager) who is accountable for one or more Data Assets in an organisation. This is generally as part of a Data Governance Framework. Areas that a Data Owner would be responsible for might include: Information Security, Data Privacy, Data Quality and more general Data Controls.

The second organisation defines how Subject data is to be processed by the Data Processor an is called a Data Controller.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-processor
Data Privacy,"This pertains to Data held by organisations about individuals (customers, counterparties etc.) and specifically to Data that can be used to identify people (personally identifiable Data), or is sensitive in nature, such as medical records, financial transactions and so on. There is a legal obligation to safeguard such Information and many regulations around how it can be used and how long it can be retained. Often the storage and use of such Data requires explicit consent from the person involved.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-privacy

Data Science,"Data Science is a term that covers a range of activities from the collection, transformation and combination of data, through exploring this to derive Insight, to applying similar Statistical techniques to those used in actual science to identify patterns, exceptions or relationships, ones that would often not be apparent via normal Data Analysis. It also encompasses developing Statistical Models, fed by the data collected, and leveraging more advanced techniques from the previously academic field of Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, Natural Language Programming and others. It also includes is the presentation of either data or the output of models using either traditional techniques, such as Dashboards, or more advanced Data Visualisations.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-science
Data Scientist,Someone au fait with exploiting Data in many formats from Flat Files to Data Warehouses to Data Lakes.

Data Scrubbing,A vigorous (sometimes too vigorous) form of Data Cleansing.,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-scrubbing
Data Service,"The provision of Data (or higher-value Information) by a Service, a dedicated piece of code whose sole purpose is to provide the Data it covers when requested by another piece of code. A Data Service will be implemented in a “black box” manner, the code that calls it does not need to know anything about how the Data Service sources or manipulates its Data, just how to call it and what it returns. Data Services are just one type of service which form part of a Service-oriented Architecture, one in which different applications communicate seamlessly with each other.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-service
Data Sourcing,"Data Sourcing is the process of acquiring Data from various Data Repositories, Databases underpinning Transactional Systems, web-site logs or other flat-file outputs, APIs, or external data sources. This can be done on a one-off basis or regularly, e.g. weekly. Typically the data sourced would be saved somewhere for later use (e.g. a spreadsheet or another Database), but equally just the rules and processes needed to acquire it may be saved allowing these to be run on demand.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-sourcing
Data Steward,"This is a concept that arises out of Data Governance. It recognises that accountability for things like Data Quality, metadata and the implementation of Data policies needs to be devolved to business departments and often locations. A Data Steward is the person within a particular part of an organisation who is responsible, on a day-to-day basis, for ensuring that their Data is fit for purpose and that their area adheres to Data policies and guidelines.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-steward
Data Strategy,"Unsurprisingly, this is strategy applied to Data. My definition of strategy is as follows:",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-strategy
Data Virtualisation,"If the Data Warehouse paradigm is to gather all source Data together in one place, Data Virtualisation instead leaves it where it was (or – more likely – in mirror copies of each system’s Data, in order to prevent transaction processing from being impacted by queries) and instead brings the Data together only when read. The term Virtualisation arises because this is like creating a virtual Data Warehouse.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-virtualisation
Data Visualisation,Techniques – such as graphs – for presenting complex Information in a manner in which it can be more easily digested by human observers. Based on the concept that a picture paints a thousand words (or a dozen Excel sheets).,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-visualisation
Data Warehouse,"A Database holding Data from many disparate sources in a common format which allows the comparison of apples and oranges. A regular warehouse is a big building in which many things may be stored, but which has an indexing system which allows them to be located and retrieved easily. A Data warehouse is essentially the same concept. Good Data Warehouses have business meaning “baked” into them. Data Warehouses generally follow a Multidimensional Paradigm (related to OLAP) where Data is held in Fact Tables (tables covering numbers such as revenue or costs) and Dimensions (things we want to view the facts by, such as region, office, or week).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-warehouse
Data Warehouse Appliance,A dedicated server which is tuned to carry out Analytical tasks very quickly. Transactional servers will be tuned to either create new records or update existing ones.

Data Wrangling,Contributor: Tenny Thomas Soman,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#data-wrangling
Decision Model (Decision Tree),"The term Decision Model is used in many contexts. Generally this is a tree-like structure with a Yes / No decision (or similar binary outcomes) at each branching point together with rules or questions to determine which path is taken. However, some Decision Models instead essentially look to Optimise a set of variables in order to reach some outcome (or avoid some other one). Broadly Decision Models are designed to help determine the best course of action in a given set of circumstances. From a Data & Analytics point of view, Decision Model refers to a model which employs Predictive Analytics to guide either each of the Yes / No decisions or the Optimisation process. Such models are typically iterative in nature.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#decision-model

In these circumstances, people would no more take a decision without finding out what the data tells them than they would forget to breathe.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#embedded-bi
End User Computing (EUC),"This is a term used to cover systems developed by people other than an organisation’s IT department or an approved commercial software vendor. It may be that such software is developed and maintained by a small group of people within a department, but more typically a single person will have created and cares for the code. EUCs may be written in mainstream languages such as Java, C++ or Python, but are frequently instead Excel- or Access-based, leveraging their shared macro/scripting language, VBA (for Visual Basic for Applications).

Genetic Algorithm,"A Genetic Algorithm is a technique employed in Optimisation problems (e.g. in Machine Learning). It uses principles similar to those seen in Darwinian Natural Selection. At one iteration, the most successful pairs of solutions are selected from the population (based on some success criteria) and combined randomly (mated one might say). The resulting progeny become the population for the next iteration. The success criteria (fitness in Darwinian terms) ensures that solutions that increase this survive, while ones that don’t face extinction.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#genetic-algorithm
Geospatial Data,"Geospatial Data is data that has a connection with an explicit location.

Graph Database,"Graph Databases consist of networks of nodes and relationships between them (mirroring the concept of a Graph in discrete mathematics, which is somewhat different to an Excel chart). The nodes contain information about entities, e.g. a trading companies, and the relationships capture how nodes are connected in different ways, e.g. supplier / customer.

Hierarchical Database,"Hierarchical Databases store Data in structures that resemble inverted trees (maybe family trees is a better analogy). These were among the first commercially available Databases, having been developed in the 1960s. Hierarchical Databases have typically been found on large mainframe computers. Although perhaps perceived as legacy software, many companies still operate these Databases which are reliable and highly performant.

For example, tracking a ball in flight and then catching it.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#image-recognition
Infographic,"Infographic is a portmanteau of Info-[rmation] + Graphic. They are intended to present data or knowledge concisely in and a visual form, which is easily digestible by viewers. While the term can be used broadly to include iconic images such as the London Tube Map, the inexorable rise of Social Media has led to Infographic being frequently applied to a specific sub-form, poster-like images providing the essentials about a subject.

Information,"Information is the first stop in the journey from Data to Information to Insight to Action. Data may be viewed as raw material, which needs to be refined in order to be useful. Information can be thought of as Data enhanced with both relationships and understanding of context. To offer a simple (if possibly also simplistic) example, the fields PID = 201705, BRNID = 12 and TOTSAL = 45766 are Data. The statement “The total sales for the Glasgow Branch in May 2017 amounted to £45,766” is Information; so is the fact that these are up 2% from the previous month and 5% up from the same month in the previous year.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#information
Information Governance,"Data Governance concerns itself with the availability, accuracy, consistency and provenance of Data. This is essentially about facilitating the use of Data and endeavouring to ensure that this leads to good decision-making. Information Governance extends this to consider constraints on the use of Data. These can include Information Security and Data Privacy. Accountability for regulatory and other compliance will generally also fall in this area. Data Governance protects the organisation’s Data and ensures it is fit for use. Information Governance protects the organisation, its customers / business partners and ensures their Data is used in an ethical and legal manner.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#information-governance
Information Security,"Information Security consists of the steps that are necessary to make sure that any Data or Information, particularly sensitive Information (trade secrets, financial Information, intellectual property, employee details, customer and supplier details and so on), is protected from unauthorised access or use. Threats to be guarded against would include everything from intentional industrial espionage, to ad hoc hacking, to employees releasing or selling company information. The practice of Information Security also applies to the (nowadays typical) situation where some elements of internal Information is made available via the internet. There is a need here to ensure that only those people who are authenticated to access such Information can do so.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#information_security
In-memory,"In a computer, Data is typically stored on some long-term media (a hard disk or solid-state drive), but needs to be brought into short-term memory in order to be accessed by the processing unit. So a cycle might be read two records from disk, load them into memory, change some value on each of them and write back to disk. There are inherent time lags in such arrangements (even with solid-state drives).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#in-memory

Insight,"Insight is the second stopping point on the journey from Data to Action, though (as per my model) a short-cut from Data to Insight may be taken sometimes. If Data might consist of the fields PID = 201705, BRNID = 12 and TOTSAL = 45766 and Information mighty be conveyed by the statement that “The total sales for the Glasgow Branch in May 2017 amounted to £45,766”, then Insight might be that increase in sales has been strongest in the 18-25 age bracket where buyers have a strong interest in personal health and fitness.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#insight
Key Performance Indicator (KPI),"Those measurements of performance that are most crucial to the understanding and monitoring the performance of a whole organisation or of parts of it.

By way of contrast, Master Data tells you about the more permanent things that the sale is associated with. These might include the office and salesperson, the type of product sold, the customer, and so on. Each of these will have a much smaller range of possible values than our example of price and it is generally important that correct values are assigned.",Analytics,None
Master Data Management (MDM),"Master Data Management is the term used to both describe the set of process by which Master Data is created, changed and deleted in an organisation and also the technological tools that can facilitate these processes.

Metadata,"Data about Data. So descriptions of what appears in fields, how these relate to other fields and what concepts bigger constructs like Tables embody. This helps people unfamiliar with a Dataset to understand how it hangs together and is good practice in the same way that documentation of any other type of code is good practice. Metadata can  be used to support some elements of Data Discovery by less technical people. It is also invaluable when there is a need for Data Migration.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#metadata

Model (Statistical Model),"A mathematical representation of some physical process (e.g. the mortality and morbidity of a population with certain attributes). Some Models may have no statistical element, e.g. cash-flow models in Finance.

Multi-dimensional Approach,"A Multidimensional Database is one which is structured in a way that most directly supports the related concept of On-line Analytical Processing (or OLAP). The multidimensional approach concentrates transactional Data (or sometimes this aggregated into balances) into a single Table called a Fact Table, which contains all pertinent Measures for an area of analysis together with links to relevant Dimensions (see below for definitions of these terms). Creating a Multidimensional Database from source Data that is structured differently is the province of Extract Transform and Load tools. Once built Information may be retrieved very quickly and users may flexibly manipulate and filter the Data in a way that makes sense to them. By way of very direct analogy, it may take quite some time to construct all of the Data that goes into an Excel pivot table, but then the pivot table can be used in a number of different ways.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#multidimensional-approach

On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP),"A rather clumsy term that arose out of On-line Transaction Processing, the latter being is what most systems support. OLAP describes structuring Data in a manner which facilitates analysis. This consists of defining Dimensions (the things we want to view Information by, such as Product, Month, Customer etc.) and Measures (the numbers we want to view, such as Sales, Returns, EBITDA etc.). This drives the Multidimensional Approach, which also underpins the design of Data Warehouses.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#online-analytical-processing
On-line Transaction Processing (OLTP),"On-line Transaction Processing is a term applied to what most people would view as the central purpose of IT systems; i.e. recording business transactions. Most commercially available software systems fall into the OLTP category. OLTP Databases are optimised for entering Data, not for querying it, something that leads to the alternative On-line Analytical Processing paradigm.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#online-transaction-processing
Operational Data Store (ODS),"A structure, generally part of an overall Data Warehouse architecture, that holds all unaggregated Data from source systems. This Data would be transformed (by ETL) to be self-consistent and may also have elements of a Multidimensional Approach applied to it. However it would differ from the main Data Warehouse structures by a) not being aggregated, b) being updated more frequently, or close to real-time and c) often maintaining less history. Its ODS is often the main source from which a Data Warehouse is built. An ODS can be used both to support operational reporting, which tends to be more detailed, and as a mechanism to provide granular Data to other applications that need it, e.g. Digital front-ends.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#operational-data-store
Operational Repository,"A Data Repository which forms a major part of a modern Data Architecture and is focussed on supporting the generation of Information (cf. an Analytical Repository, which is focussed on supporting the generation of Insight).

Optimisation,"Optimisation refers to a process for selecting the best (optimum) outcome from a set of possible alternatives. Such processes tend to be iterative in nature with a best outcome emerging after a number of cycles (possibly limited, i.e. select the best result after 100 cycles). Optimisation is the province of an area of Mathematics and Computer Science called Optimisation Theory.

Overfitting,"A problem in Statistics and Machine Learning where a Model matches the data used to create it so well that it loses explicative power when presented with further related data sets. Most models aim to separate Signal from Noise, overfitting normally occurs where this has been unsuccessful and the Model is instead explaining Noise specific to the initial data set.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#overfitting
Pattern Recognition,"This is a broad term covering activities in areas such as neuroscience; but here the focus is on the recognition of patterns in data. This could be identifying potentially suspicious bank transactions, teasing out meaning from the petabytes generated by a Large Hadron Collider experiment, finding edges in a photograph, or working out which people a COVID-19 sufferer has come into contact with in the last month. Often a phenomenon is broken into constituent parts and patterns are examined in each, before the pieces are reconstituted. There are clearly linkages between Pattern Recognition and both Machine Learning and Image Recognition.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#pattern-recognition
Personal Data,"Personal Data both has an obvious general meaning and a more technical one under GDPR, but the meanings are not mutually inconsistent. To take the more precise definition, Personal Data is data which relates to a specific, identified person, or which may allow a specific person to be identified. So while obviously things like full name, full postal address and Governament-issued ID numbers (e.g. Passport Number, Social Security Number in the US, National Insurance Number or NHS Number in the UK) are Personal Data, so might be a combination of location and demographic data if this uniquely identifies a single person (or indeed a small group of people). In a hypothetical situation, there might be only one male of Uzbek ethnicity in Fordwich, Kent (population 381).",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#personal-data
Personally Identifiable Information (PII),"Personally Identifiable Information is a US term which is often used synonymously with Personal Data.

Reference Data,Contributor: George Firican,Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#reference-data
Referential Integrity,"A concept within Relational Databases, which consist of Tables with Columns and relationships between the contents of these. For example a table may record a customer’s contact details, including Country. A list of valid Countries and the codes associated the them will be stored in another, look-up, or reference, Table (sometimes referred to as Master Data). An example of Referential Integrity would be that only Country codes that are defined in the look-up, or reference, Table should appear on the Customer details table. Such Referential Integrity may be enforced in a number of ways. If, for example, an application (e.g. a Sales System) sits above the Database, then the code of this system may ensure Referential Integrity. Also, many Databases have features (e.g. explicit constraints, or triggers containing validation code executed when a record is created or updated) that allow Referential Integrity to be implemented. It is a challenge to maintain Referential Integrity through events such as: a manual fix to some error in the Database, a Database or application update, transferring Data to a reporting or analytics Database. There is also the issue that Reference Data can change over time, e.g. Czechoslovakia became the Czech Republic and Slovakia.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#referential-integrity
Relational Database,"A Database that stores Data in Tables with relations between them. E.g. There may be a Customer table with contact details and marketing preferences and a Sales table linked to this with products, price and purchase dates. Relational Databases have their contents created, modified and read using the industry standard SQL language. Relational Databases have been the de facto standard for supporting all IT systems in the last 40 years. They remain the standard for transactional systems (web-sites, sales systems, General Ledgers) and for statutory, regulatory and publicly available Information. Since the mid-2000s they have been challenged in the Insight and Analyticsspace by Big Data solutions.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#rdbms
Report,"As may be determined from the name, the genesis of Reports were documents prepared to inform a superior of what was going on; think of reports of “progress” at the front being relayed to World War I generals by their subordinates. In a business context such updates to management inevitably contained figures as well as commentary. With the advent of electronic computers, it became possible to produce the figures bit of reports automatically and this became somewhat decoupled from the explanatory commentary, with the former retaining the term Report. In early years (and even 2019) many Reports would have been produced on paper (often paper with sprocket holes). As visual display units became more common and of a higher specification, Reports became something that could be consumed on a screen (or SmartPhone), but many acres of woodland still go into printing them.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#report

Robotic Process Automation (RPA),"Robotic Process Automation is a method for automating business processes that obviates the need to describe these processes in full detail. In normal process automation, a developer will have to model the activity to be automated in code (or more likely some sort of pseudo-code if using an automation tool) and make calls to APIs to process the relevant transactions. With RPA, Machine Learning techniques are initially used to “observe” users completing tasks (e.g. entering data into an application or web-page) and determine how to do the same. The software agent can then carry out these tasks themselves, mimicking  fingertip input rather than calling an API. Some RPA agents can also learn how to complete related tasks not covered by the initial Training phase.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#robotic-process-automation

Self-service [BI or Analytics],"Self-service in either BI or Analytics has precisely the same meaning as in a restaurant, patrons wander up to a food bar with their plates and put whatever they like on them. Self-service has become the objective of many data-centric projects and programmes, ostensibly putting the needs of “customers” of data at the centre of work. However there is an alternative interpretation, that the projects and programmes have given up trying to provide data sets that meet people’s needs as it is too hard. Instead they provide access to data and say “it’s now your problem to do stuff with it”. Maybe the truth lies somewhere between these extremes. However it is undeniable that the success or failure of a Data Lake is inextricably linked to how well it is Curated and that of a Data Warehouse is similarly correlated to the fidelity with which its Data Model reflects business needs. Self-service is a good tool to have the in bag when looking to deliver a complete data solution, but it is unwise to have it be the only tool in the bag.",Analytics,https://peterjamesthomas.com/data-and-analytics-dictionary/#self-service
